The model I demonstrate here, named \emph{git-flow}, originates from 2010 -- not very long after Git itself came into being. It has become popular in its adoption and development in many software teams, perhaps even considered standard protocol. This model is geared more towards continuous delivery and integration, such as scheduled data releases, web development etc. where explicit versioning or multiple version support is required.

\subsection{The main branches}

The central repo holds two main branches with an infinite lifetime, \codeinline{master} and \codeinline{develop}, where \codeinline{develop} runs parallel to the \codeinline{master} branch. By definition, consider these two branches for source code of \codeinline{HEAD} as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \codeinline{origin/master} always reflects a production-ready state,
	\item \codeinline{origin/develop} always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release, enabling automatic production/CI builds overnight.
\end{itemize}

	\caption[Main branches]{Main branches \codeinline{master} and \codeinline{develop} of the \emph{git-flow} branching model.}
\end{figure}

When stable and release-ready, \codeinline{develop} branch source code is merged back into \codeinline{master} and tagged with a release number, generating a new production release \emph{by definition}. Keeping this strict enables use of Git hooks automatically build and roll-out software to our production servers per commit to \codeinline{master}.



\subsection{Supporting branches}

This development model's supporting branches lay adjacent to the main branches \codeinline{master} and \codeinline{develop}, enabling;

\begin{itemize}
	\item Parallel development between team members,
	\item Ease of feature-tracking,
	\item Production release preparation,
	\item Effective fixing of live production problems.
\end{itemize}

\noindent These branches are \codeinline{feature}, \codeinline{release}, and \codeinline{hotfix}. \newline

Unlike the main branches, these branches are designed to have finite lifetime, and each have a specific purpose and are bound to strict rules to accept particular branches as origin or target destination on merging.

Remember, all Git branches are technically the same – even \codeinline{master} is just an ordinary branch, created by default and most people opt to keep it – but instead these branch types are categorized by how we use them.



\subsection{Feature branches}

Feature branches are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. They exist as long as the feature is in development and must either eventually be merged back into \codeinline{develop}, or discarded. \newline

\noindent Typically, feature branches exist in developer repos only, not in \codeinline{origin}. \newline

\noindent When starting work on a new feature, branch off from the \codeinline{develop} branch.

\begin{git-bash}[switch to new-feature branch]
    git checkout -b new-feature develop
\end{git-bash}

\noindent and when finished, features may be merged into \codeinline{develop} for inclusion in the upcoming release:

\begin{git-bash}[finish new-feature branch]
    git checkout develop
    git merge --no-ff new-feature
    git branch -d new-feature
    git push origin develop
\end{git-bash}

Where the \codeinline{--no-ff flag} ensures the merge creates a new commit object, even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward. This prevents information loss about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature.

\vspace{12\baselineskip}%

	\noindent\resizebox{.66\textwidth}{!}{\input{src/book/03-branches/img-model-feature}}
	\caption[Main branches]{Demonstration of fast-forwarding \codeinline{feature} branch merges onto \codeinline{develop} branches.}
\end{figure}

\noindent Whilst \codeinline{--no-ff} creates a few more (empty) commit objects, it enables:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Visibility of commit objects together have implemented a feature in the Git history, eliminating laborious log messages traversal,
	\item Reverting a whole feature (i.e. a group of commits), with insight and reason from the Git history.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Release branches}

Release branches support preparation of a new production release facilitating last-minute corrections and preparing meta-data for a release (version number, build dates, etc.) ready for handover to \codeinline{develop}.

When \codeinline{develop} reflects the desired state of the new release, create a \codeinline{release} branch from \codeinline{develop} that includes all completed features, ie. No partial features. It is exactly at the start of a release branch that the upcoming release gets assigned a version number -- not any earlier. 

\begin{git-bash}[switch to release branch]
    git checkout -b release-1.2 develop
    ./bump-version.sh 1.2
    git commit -am "Bumped version number to 1.2"
\end{git-bash}

After creating a new branch and switching to it, we bump the version number. This new branch may exist there for a while, until the release may be rolled out. Once all bug fixes have been applied in this branch, the bumped version number is committed. Adding large new features here is strictly prohibited. They \textbf{must} be merged into \codeinline{develop}, and therefore, wait for the next big release. \newline

When the state of release is ready to become a real release:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Merge onto \codeinline{master}, since every commit on \codeinline{master} is a new release by definition,
	\item Then \codeinline{tag} that commit on \codeinline{master} for easy future reference to this historical version,
	\item Merge the changes made on the \codeinline{release} branch onto \codeinline{develop} to carry these bug fixes into future releases.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{git-bash}[finish release branch]
    git checkout develop
    git merge --no-ff release-1.2
\end{git-bash}

Completing these steps will most likely give rise to a merge conflict since the version number has been updated. Fix this and commit to finalise the release process. The \codeinline{release} branch may now be removed.

\begin{git-bash}[finish release branch]
    git branch -d release-1.2
\end{git-bash}



\subsection{Hotfix branches}

You can consider \codeinline{hotfix} as critical \codeinline{release} branches: preparation spaces for new production releases with urgency to act on a bug(s) of a live production version. When a bug is identified for immediate resolve, spawn a new \codeinline{hotfix} branch from the corresponding tag on \codeinline{master} that marks the production version.

This allows the development team, who operate on the \codeinline{develop} branch and below, to maintain momentum whilst an assignee prepares the production hotfix. \newline

If the current production release, say version 1.2, is live with bug that requires immediate attention, a \codeinline{hotfix} branch may be created from \codeinline{master}.

\begin{git-bash}[switch to hotfix branch]
    git checkout -b hotfix-1.2.1 master
    ./bump-version.sh 1.2.1
    git commit -a -m "Bumped version number to 1.2.1"
\end{git-bash}

\emph{Ensure you bump the version number after branching off!} Then, fix the bug and commit the fix in one or more separate commits.

\begin{git-bash}[commit hotfix]
    git commit -m "Fixed severe production problem"
\end{git-bash}

Similar to completing the \codeinline{release} branch process, once the critical bug has been fixed, \codeinline{hotfix} needs to be merged back both into \codeinline{master} and \codeinline{develop} in order to safeguard that the bugfix is included in the next release.

The key difference between the two patterns is, \emph{when a \codeinline{release} branch currently exists, the hotfix changes need to be merged into that \codeinline{release} branch, instead of \codeinline{develop}}.

Back-merging the bugfix into the release branch will eventually result in the bugfix being merged into \codeinline{develop} too, when the release branch is finished. If work in \codeinline{develop} immediately requires this bugfix and cannot wait for the release branch to be finished, you may safely merge the bugfix into \codeinline{develop} now already as well.

The steps follow:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Update master and tag the release,
\begin{git-bash}[finish release branch]
    git checkout master
    git merge --no-ff hotfix-1.2.1
    git tag -a 1.2.1
\end{git-bash}
	
	\item Include the bugfix in develop,
\begin{git-bash}[switch from hotfix to develop]
    git checkout develop
    git merge --no-ff hotfix-1.2.1
\end{git-bash}

	\item Remove the temporary branch.
\begin{git-bash}[remove hotfix branch]
    git branch -d hotfix-1.2.1
\end{git-bash}
\end{enumerate}
