The model I demonstrate here, named \emph{git-flow} originates from 2010 -- not very long after Git itself came into being. It has become popular in its adoption and development in many software teams, perhaps even considered standard protocol. This model is geared more towards continuous delivery and integration, such as scheduled data releases, web development etc. where explicit versioning or multiple version support is required.
