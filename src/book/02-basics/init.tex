\section{The perfect commit}
\input{src/book/02-basics/commit}



\subsection{Committing files}

Some of the first commands you learn with Git will be to initialise and track your working directory locally.

\begin{git-bash}[basic commit]
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your message"
\end{git-bash}

To quicken your time on the command line, you can skip the \codeinline{git add} step using the \codeinline{-am} flag with \codeinline{git commit} to automatically add all the files in the current working directory:

\begin{git-bash}[quick commit]
    git commit -am "Your message"
\end{git-bash}

If you've committed with a spelling error, update the latest commit message with

\begin{git-bash}[amending messages]
    git commit --amend -m "Updated message"
\end{git-bash}

\noindent or if you've forgotten to add a file to your latest commit:

\begin{git-bash}[add a file onto a commit]
    git add extra_file.txt
    git commit --amend --no-edit
\end{git-bash}

\noindent where the \codeinline{--no-edit} flag retains the original commit message.



\subsection{Stash}

If you have changes that almost work but they can't really be committed yet because they break everything else or aren't up to par with the code style, or you just don't want your colleagues to see it yet, \codeinline{git stash} will remove the changes from your working directory and save them for later use without committing them to the repo

\begin{git-bash}[basic stash]
    git stash
    git pop
\end{git-bash}

You can assign the stash a name to reference it later with \codeinline{git pop} when you're ready to add those changes back into your code. Use \codeinline{git stash list} to view all aliased stashes, find the stash you can to retrieve followed by \codeinline{git stash apply} with the corresponding index to use it

\begin{git-bash}[list stash]
    git stash save coolstuff
    git stash list
    git stash apply 0
\end{git-bash}



\subsection{Destroy things}

Imagine you have a remote repository on GitHub and a local version on your machine you've been making changes to, but things haven't been going too well and you just want to go back to the original state on the remote repo.

First do a \codeinline{git fetch} to grab the latest code in the remote repo, then use \codeinline{reset} with the \codeinline{--hard} flag to overwrite your local code with the remote code, but be careful, your local changes will be lost forever.

\begin{git-bash}[ditch local code]
    git fetch origin
    git reset --hard origin/master
\end{git-bash}

But you might still be left with some random untracked files and build artefacts here or there. Use the \codeinline{git clean} command to remove those files as well

\begin{git-bash}[ditch local code]
    git clean -df
\end{git-bash}



\subsection{Checkout}

If you recently switch out of a branch and forgot its name, you can use \codeinline{git checkout} followed by a dash to go directory back into the previously branch you were working on

\begin{git-bash}[switch back to previous branch]
    git checkout -
\end{git-bash}



\subsection{Switch}

If you find yourself working on a branch and need to move your current untracked changes to another (new or existing) branch, then \codeinline{git switch} is the perfect use case for when you just want to test something, but you're not sure it's worth it.

\begin{git-bash}[switch back to previous branch]
    git switch -c new-branch
\end{git-bash}

You can achieve the same effect with \codeinline{git checkout -b new-branch}, but \codeinline{checkout} does more than just switching branches, so \codeinline{switch} was created for specificity.

	\caption[Recording changes to the repository]{%
		All possible movements of recording changes within a repository. Each file in a working directory can be either \emph{tracked} or \emph{untracked}. Tracked files are those included in the last snapshot (unmodified, modified or staged), and untracked files are all other files in your working directory that were not in the last snapshot or in the staging area.
